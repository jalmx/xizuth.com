  <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
  <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
    app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
    source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
    derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
    property rights related to it, still belong to Xizuth Inc.</p>
  <p>Xizuth Inc is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
    and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
    to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
  <p>The Dotw, Ohm's Law X, TemperatureConverter X, Nto app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
    our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
    and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
    to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
    the Dotw, Ohm's Law X, TemperatureConverter X, Nto app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
  <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Xizuth Inc will not take responsibility
    for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
    can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Xizuth Inc cannot take responsibility
    for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
    of your data allowance left.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
    app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
    charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
    or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
    you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
    payer for using the app.</p>
  <p>Along the same lines, Xizuth Inc cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
    the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
    you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Xizuth Inc cannot accept responsibility.</p>
  <p>With respect to Xizuth Inc’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
    the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
    correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
    it available to you. Xizuth Inc accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
    you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
  <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
    requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
    of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
    app. Xizuth Inc does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
    to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However,
    you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
    stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
    you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
    device.
